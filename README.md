# Verify



## Introduction

VERIFY is a web application that will validate an RSA ID number that users will input from the UI. Given that a South African ID number is a 13-digit number which is defined by the following format: YYMMDDSSSSCAZ.

    The first six digits (YYMMDD) are based on your date of birth – 23 January 1988 is 880123.
    The next four digits (SSSS) are used to define your gender – females are assigned numbers in the range 0000-4999 and males from 5000-9999.
    The next digit (C) shows if you are an SA citizen – 0 – or a permanent resident – 1.
    The next digit (A) was used until the late 1980s to indicate a person’s race. This has been eliminated and old ID numbers were reissued to remove this.
    The last digit (Z) is a checksum digit – used to check that the number sequence is accurate using the Luhn algorithm.
